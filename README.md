THE IDEA IN BRIEF
A smart attendance software was developed which combines Computer Vision and Databases. The project involved Face Recognition being implied to mark a students presence in classroom. 
Entry Time and Exit Time of a student is noted and according to the time interval, his attendance is marked in respective lectures. 
The data is then stored to a file, which is retrieved by a database handling system, by which an administrator can Query it and extract relevant information. 
The project works completely in real time

TECHNOLOGIES USED
1.OpenCV C++ libraries to implement Face Recognition.
2.Qt C++ for the GUI and backend processing.
3.Sqlite for managing the Database.

Add your Face Database into Facerec folder.

Then run python script a.py 

eg. python a.py Facerec/ b.csv

Update values of rec_op string (line 127) according to .csv file,

Then train your data set using try.cpp file.
